# First Steps
**GMRS License:** [FCC Universal Licensing System (ULS)](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/universal-licensing-system)

*GMRS licesning has a fee that is adjusted annually and the license is good for 10 years. 
You can also file an FCC Form 605 if online is not your preferred method, though it will delay license approval*

## Not A Rubicon Notes - GMRS Quick Guide

### General Information
- **GMRS** operates on **UHF** frequencies; **HAM** operates on **VHF**.
- Frequency range: **462-467 MHz**.
- **22 Channels**, including **8 repeater channels**.
  - Repeater channels overlap on channels **15-22**.

### Key Concepts
- **Simplex**: Direct communication between radios without a repeater.
- **Repeaters**: Towers that amplify signals for long-distance communication.
- **Broadcasting**: Correct term is **transmitting**.
- FCC regulations require announcing your **call sign** at least every **15 minutes**.

### Practical Tips
- RF travels by **line of sight**: get to a high point for better signals.
- Avoid interference: separate radios to improve communication.
- Hand-held radios (**HT**) are also called **walkie-talkies** or **hand talkies**.

### Power and Range
- **Max legal power**: 50 watts.
  - 20 watts with a proper antenna can often match the range of a 50-watt radio.
- Range comparisons:
  - **5-watt** HT: ~10-14 miles (simplex), shorter for repeaters.
  - **Higher wattage**: Access repeaters up to **50 miles** away.

### Etiquette and Usage
- No formal GMRS etiquette.
- HAM radios cannot transmit on GMRS frequencies but can listen.
- Channels:
  - **1-7**: Up to **5 watts**, suitable for team movements.
  - **8-14**: Limited to **0.5 watts**, ideal for short-range use (e.g., base or camp).
  - **15-22**: Up to **50 watts**, used for long-range communication.
- **CTCSS (analog)** and **DCS (digital)** codes:
  - Enable filtering to avoid unwanted chatter but do not encrypt the channel.

### Advanced Features
- **SOC (System on a Chip)** and **ROC (Radio on a Chip)** technologies.
- DIY repeater setups add separate tones for custom configurations.
- "Privacy tones":
  - Not secure or encrypted but reduce outside interference.

## Deeper Dive into Repeaters
- Repeaters enable **hundreds of miles** of range with just a **5-watt HT**.
- Listening:
  - Channels **15-22** can receive but not transmit.
- Transmitting:
  - Requires setting the correct **repeater channel** and tone code.
- **Wideband settings**:
  - Ensure radios (e.g., Baofeng) are configured for **wideband** for GMRS.
- Testing repeaters:
  - "Squelch tail" or "kick tail" verifies connection to the repeater.

### Repeater Channels
- **Transmit/Receive Channels**:
  - **15-22**.
- Overlapping channels:
  - **1-8**.

### Important Notes
- Setting transmit tones is mandatory.
- Ignore receive tones in modern setups; they are not required for GMRS.
