# Wireless-Communication-WiCom-Vault

## Purpose
This repository is an attempt to consolidate and organize information on useful off-grid wireless frequencies to provide step-by-step and turn-key solutions for the average user.

## Structure
1. All files are written in .md with the intent that the highest folder, the WiCom Folder, can be downloaded and placed into an Obsidian Vault for personal reference and to edit with one's own notes.
2. Nothing is proprietary, all of the information is freely available at various sites across the internet, and recommendations are my own (though often reviewed with friends & teammates).
3. I do accept revision suggestions and reiterations / expansions so long as there's no obvious conflict of interest.
4. These are placed as **free-to-end-user (FTEU)** and should be evaluated on an individual basis as I can't be held liable for what you do with this information going forward.
5. As always, use common sense, follow federal laws and local legislation since this is not updated in real-time.

## Disclosures
1. I often use AI systems to write the structure and basic information, which I then go into and edit / refine / organize. The information isn't strictly written by AI or by myself.
2. There are often collaborators, some wish to be credited and some remain anonymous. If the information is of public domain, I do my best to source the information within reason.
3. This is **NOT** a paid Vault or product and is free to anyone who is interested in starting their journey into Emergency, Backup, and Off-Grid communications.
4. I am **NOT** sponsored, I am **NOT** a professional radio operator of any kind, I do **NOT** do this for a living, and am merely a hobbyist who wants to reduce the learning curve for others in the future.
5. This will remain FTEU and edited as I learn / develop new information. There is not price attached to the information and if anyone does attempt to charge you, it is not myself or my team.
